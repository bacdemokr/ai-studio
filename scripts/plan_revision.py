    'materially misleading results. Minor rounding, chart styling or wording issues can be disclosed '
    'without another generation pass; do not describe known inaccuracies as correct. Explicit user '

    'reasons to repeat work. '
    'A generic request to read the file again, confirm it was saved, or verify every requirement is NOT a blocking defect. '
    'Successful saved-file evidence already establishes delivery, not browser execution. If no concrete failure '
    'has been observed, finish with any unperformed execution checks stated as limitations. '
    'Perform a necessary narrow source check yourself using the supplied readPath; do not send the author back '
    'just to confirm its implementation. Preserve any independent review explicitly requested by the user. '
